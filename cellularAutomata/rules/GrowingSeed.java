    /**
     * Create a growing cyclic plague using the given cellular automaton
     * properties.
     * 
	 * <p>
	 * When calling the parent constructor, the minimalOrLazyInitialization
	 * parameter must be included as
	 * <code>super(minimalOrLazyInitialization);</code>. The boolean is
	 * intended to indicate when the constructor should build a rule with as
	 * small a footprint as possible. In order to load rules by reflection, the
	 * application must query this class for information like the display name,
	 * tooltip description, etc. At these times it makes no sense to build the
	 * complete rule which may have a large footprint in memory.
	 * <p>
	 * It is recommended that the constructor and instance variables do not
	 * initialize any memory intensive variables and that variables be
	 * initialized only when first needed (lazy initialization). Or all
	 * initializations in the constructor may be placed in an <code>if</code>
	 * statement.
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * if(!minimalOrLazyInitialization)
	 * {
	 *     ...initialize
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * @param minimalOrLazyInitialization
	 *            When true, the constructor instantiates an object with as
	 *            small a footprint as possible. When false, the rule is fully
	 *            constructed. This variable should be passed to the super
	 *            constructor <code>super(minimalOrLazyInitialization);</code>,
	 *            but if uncertain, you may safely ignore this variable.
