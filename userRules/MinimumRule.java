	 * Create the rule that assigns the minimum of it's neighbors.

	 * When calling the parent constructor, the minimalOrLazyInitialization
	 * parameter must be included as shown. The boolean is intended to indicate
	 * when the constructor should build a rule with as small a footprint as
	 * possible. In order to load rules by reflection, the application must
	 * query this class for information like the display name, tooltip
	 * description, etc. At these times it makes no sense to build the complete
	 * rule which may have a large footprint in memory.
	 * <p>
	 * It is recommended that the constructor and instance variables do not
	 * initialize any memory intensive variables and that variables be
	 * initialized only when first needed (lazy initialization). Or all
	 * initializations in the constructor may be placed in an <code>if</code>
	 * statement.

	 *     ...initialize

	 * @param minimalOrLazyInitialization
	 *            When true, the constructor instantiates an object with as
	 *            small a footprint as possible. When false, the rule is fully
	 *            constructed. This variable should be passed to the super
	 *            constructor (for example,
	 *            <code>super(minimalOrLazyInitialization);</code>), but if
	 *            uncertain, you may safely ignore this variable.
