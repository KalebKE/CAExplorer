<b> Symmetry.</b>
</p>
<p>
An illustration of the symmetry present in so many cellular automata rules. In 
this case, each cell adds up the values of its neighbors (excluding itself). If 
the sum is 1, 2, or 3, then the cell turns on. If the sum is 0, or 4 or more, 
then the cell turns off. This dependence on the sum makes it both an
<a href="OuterTotalistic.html">Outer Totalistic</a> rule and an extension of the
<a href="Life.html">Life</a> rule (where birth, death, and survival depends on 
the sum of neighboring cells).</p>
