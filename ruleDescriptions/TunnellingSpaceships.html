<b>Tunnelling Spaceships.</b>
</p>
<p>
A rule which produces spaceship-like lines, and a wide variety of other behaviors depending on the number of states and the lattice.  For some of the best spaceships choose a square (Margolus) 100 by 100 lattice with 31 states and a 50% random initial state. Some states tunnel through others with no effect, while others tunnel and eat their surroundings as they go. Other choices for the number of states look like Majority Probably Wins, simple translations, or premature death.  In one-dimension, the rule produces complex streams of colliding data that usually end in Class II cycles.

<p>
How's the rule work?  The neighbors (not including the cell) are concatenated into a single value.  This value is converted to a base 10 integer. The neighbor that corresponds to that integer (modulo the number of neighbors) is selected as the cell's new value. 
</p>
<p>
For example, in one dimension with nearest neighbors and two states (0 and 1), the left and right neighbors may each have values 1.  These concatenate to 11 in base 2, which is the integer 3 in base 10.  There are two neighbors which can be numbered 0 and 1.  Because 3 mod 2 = 1, the 2nd neighbor (number 1) is selected.  The 2nd neighbor has value 1.  Therefore, the cell's new value will be 1.
</p>
<p>
In two dimensions, the cells are numbered clockwise starting at the upper left (see the tooltip descriptions of the lattices).  For example, on a square (8 neighbor) lattice, the neighbors are numbered as 
<pre>
         012
         7x3
         654
</pre>
with the cell x in the middle.  When concatenated the cells are arranged as 01234567.  In the one-dimensional nearest-neighbor lattice, the neighbors are arranged as 0x1 and when concatenated, they are arranged as 01.
</p>
<p>
This rule is very similar to Chutes, Ladders, and Shifts.  When concatenating, the cell itself is not included in this rule, but it is included in Chutes, Ladders, and Shifts.
