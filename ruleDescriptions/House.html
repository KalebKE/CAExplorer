<b>House</b></p>
<p>
Creates houses! If you have looked at a lot of cellular automata (CA), this may seem very surprising.
A common complaint is that all CA tend to look similar -- 
upside-down triangles, spirals, symmetric snow-flakes, and other common patterns. But there is no 
limit to the shapes that can be created with CA's. We 
tend to see the same shapes, over and over, only because we restrict ourselves to small numbers of states 
on lattices with small neighborhoods. And typically we focus on rules that encourage symmetry, 
like <a href="OuterTotalistic.html">Outer Totalistic</a>.
<p>
By allowing large neighborhoods or a large number of states, we can create shapes like houses. 
In this case, the rule uses 57 states on a standard square 8 neighbor (Moore) lattice. 
Each cell looks at its neighbors and says "ok, if this particular state is above me, then I need to 
turn into this other state."  So for example, the tip of the roof is state 56. The cell below and to the left
sees that 56 and knows that it needs to become state 55; and the cell below and to the right of the 56 knows that it 
needs to become state 54.  So really, there is no mystery.  We can draw any desired shape on a lattice, 
and then consecutively number every pixel/cell on the shape.  Each of these numbers becomes a state.  
Each cell/pixel looks at its neighbors and knows what its value should be in relation to the other cells.
<p>
If you look at the code, it is tedious but straightforward.

<code>
	if(cell == 56)
	{
		return 56;
	}
	else if(neighbors[2] == 56)
	{
		return 55;
	}
	else if(neighbors[0] == 56)
	{
		return 54;
	}
	else if(neighbors[5] == 48)
	{
		return 53;
	}
	else if(...)
	{
		...
	}
	else
	{
		return 0;
	}
</code>

See? The new value of each cell depends only on its neighbors.
