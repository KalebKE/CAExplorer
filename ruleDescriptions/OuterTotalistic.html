<b>Outer Totalistic.</b>

<p>
A class of beautiful and often symmetric rules that depend only on the sum of the neighbors and, 
separately, the cell's value. In other words, the rule depends (1) on the total of the 
values of the neighbors (excluding the cell itself), and (2) also (separately) the value of 
the cell itself. 
<p>
The rule is specified by a code number. For example, consider a 1-d nearest-neighbor rule 
with only two states (0 and 1). The sum of the neighbors may be 2, 1, 
or 0. Also, the center cell can have a value of 0 or 1.  So the 
possible pairs of {total, cell value} are {2, 1}, {2, 0}, {1, 1}, 
{1, 0}, {0, 1}, and {0, 0}.  For each of these pairs, the center cell 
can map to a 0 or 1.  Suppose they map to 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 0 
respectively.  Then that is the binary number 111110, or the number 62 
 in decimal.  This 62 is the "code" for the outer totalistic rule.
