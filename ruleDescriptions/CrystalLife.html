<b>Crystal Life</b><p>Beautiful growing crystals with gliders that are 
reminiscent of <a href="Life.html">Life</a>. This is
<a href="OuterTotalistic.html">Outer Totalistic</a> rule 435 with two states, 
but the running average is set at 2 to prevent annoying blinking. (See
<a href="EpilepticBlobs.html">Epileptic Blobs</a> for an explanation of the 
blinking shown by so many Outer Totalistic rules.)</p>
<p>Starting from symmetric initial states, this CA produces gorgeous crystals 
that grow very slowly or stay at roughly the same size. The long-term behavior 
has not been mapped, but the slow or negligible growth along with the appearance 
of gliders suggests that this CA might be capable of universal computation. 
Other two-dimensional CA capable of universal computation (like Life) do not 
display unbounded growth. On the other hand, many of the the Outer Totalistic 
rules that produce crystals do have unbounded growth (e.g., see
<a href="Snowflake.html">Snow Flake</a>).</p>
<p>Gliders can be created from an initial state given by

<p><i>Why are there three colors</i> if there are only two states? The CA 
defaults to a running average of 2 time steps (you can change this if you like).&nbsp;When averaging two values, a 0 and a 0 averages to a 0.&nbsp;A 1 and a 1 
averages to a 1. And a 1 and a 0 averages to a 0.5.&nbsp;The 0.5 is the third 
color.&nbsp;To see the simulation with the original two colors (two states), 
just set the running average to 1.&nbsp;As emphasized in many rules, the manner 
in which a CA is displayed can convey very different information.</p>
