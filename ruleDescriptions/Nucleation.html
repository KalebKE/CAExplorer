<p>
Colorful spirals nucleate out of initial disorder. The time it takes to 
nucleate depends on the number of states, with smaller numbers nucleating faster. 
For the default 14 states, run the simulation for 250 or more generations to see 
the spirals. 
<p>
This rule is a classic cyclic CA. Each cell can only update its state from <i>n</i> to 
<i>n+1</i> (modulo <i>N</i>) where <i>N</i> is the number 
of states. In other words, each cell cycles through all possible values.  Also, a 
cell only increments its current state (<i>n</i>) if there is 1 or more neighbors with 
the next state (<i>n+1</i>).
