<b> Fractal No Neighbor.</b>
</p>
<p>
Generates amazing Mandelbrot and Julia fractals from a CA that uses complex numbers as values for each cell.
<p>
Each cell in this simulation ignores its neighbors, and some would therefore argue that this isn't a cellular 
automaton at all. Generally speaking, a CA is a function of the cell and its neighbors. At an extreme, that 
can include functions which look only at the cell and ignores the neighbors altogether.  Certainly it is 
not unusual for CA to ignore particular neighbors, or to ignore different neighbors at different time steps.  
So ignoring all of the neighbors is just one end of the spectrum of possibilities. Considered in this light, 
almost all iterative functions can be cast as CA. Just apply a function to the cell itself, over and over.  
Is that reasonable?  Perhaps.  It's certainly extreme.  But it does point out the close relationship 
between CA and fractals.  Many fractals, like the ones created by this rule, are just iterative applications 
of functions on the complex plane.
<p>
This particular CA rule (which acts only on the cell) applies the function f(z) to the complex numbered cell value z.  
The function f is "i sinh(z)" by default, but may be reset 
in the "More Properties" window to other complex functions like f = i sin, (i+1) cos, i tan, (i+1) tanh, etc. 
After a series of steps, the cell's value is just the iterative application of f, as f(f(f(f(...f(z)))). For example, 
i sinh(i sinh(i sinh(i sinh(...z)))).  The result is stunningly beautiful fractals when viewed properly.
<p>
In fact, from a CA perspective, what is particularly interesting is not this rule but the way in which the cell's are viewed. 
Each cell can be viewed as either the complex modulus (a shaded value that 
depends on the distance from origin) or as a fractal.  Fractals are derived from 
the equation z = z<sup>2</sup> + c where z (the value of the cell) is iterated repeatedly. 
If the value diverges, the cell is given a light (or empty) color.  If the value 
converges, the cell is given a dark (or full) color.  The rate at which it diverges 
determines shades in between -- the faster the divergence then the lighter the color, 
and the slower the divergence then the darker the color. 
<p>
The Mandelbrot set is derived when c is set to the initial value of the cell.  A 
Julia set is derived when c is a fixed value for all cells.  For Julia sets, the 
value of c may be set in the "More Properties" window. 
<p>
Clearly, a relatively simple CA can take fascinating shapes and patterns when
viewed in a "different light" as a fractal.  In fact, that's the real lesson here.

is no one correct way to display a cellular automaton, and different displays may highlight 
otherwise hidden information.</b>
