<b>Snowflake Dust</b>
<p>
This is outer totalistic rule 68 which produces snowflake "dust" reminiscent 
of Cantor Dust (a well known fractal). Try starting from 
a <b>single seed</b>. 
<p>
Other outer totalistic rules near 68 also produce dust.  To try them, 
select the <a href="OuterTotalistic.html">Outer Totalistic</a> rule and enter a rule number like 70 or 76. 
Even numbers work best.
