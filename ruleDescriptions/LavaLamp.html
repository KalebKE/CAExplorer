Each cell can only update its state from i to i+1 (modulo N) where N is the number 
of states. In other words, each cell cycles through all possible values.  Also, a 
cell only increments its current state (i) if there are 10 or more neighbors with 
the next state (i+1).
<p>
This cyclic CA was inspired by a similar one from Jason Rampe.
