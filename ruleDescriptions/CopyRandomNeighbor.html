<b>Copy Random Neighbor</b>
<p>
Copies the value of a random neighbor. Note that this does not "conserve mass" or "conserve values".  
Regions with a particular cell value may grow or shrink in number depending on what gets 
randomly copied.  This growth and decay of values is particularly obvious in one-dimensional 
simulations.
<p>
Also note that in one-dimensional simulations running at high speed, you can occasionally see 
"dithering". That's when two closely interspersed colors appear to the eye as a third blended color. 
For example, red and blue colors mixed together in a checkerboard pattern may 
appear as purple.</p>
