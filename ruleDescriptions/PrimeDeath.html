<b>Prime Death</b>
<p>
Very similar to <a href="BriansBrain.html">Brian's Brain</a> and 
<a href="Life.html">Life</a>.  Most patterns create gliders. 
Cells are born if they have exactly 2 or 6 "alive" neighbors. They die 
if they have a prime number of alive neighbors. Otherwise they survive. 
<p>
Only cells that have state 1 are counted as "alive".  When a cell 
dies, it slowly fades away by cycling through the higher valued 
states.  Once the highest state is reached, the cell is set to state 
0.  These higher valued states take space on the grid, but they do 
not count as alive neighbors.
