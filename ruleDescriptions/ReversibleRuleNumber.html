<b>Reversible</b>
<p>
Rules that run the same both forwards and backwards.  These are 
useful in physics because most fundamental laws operate the same 
way both forward and backwards in time. 
<p>
In these simulations, a cell's current value depends on both the 
previous generation, and the generation before that. And, because the 
simulation is reversible, each generation has a unique previous state.&nbsp; 
Most CA do not have unique previous states.
<p>
Reversible rules may be constructed in many ways. These reversible 
rules are constructed from the corresponding <a href="WolframRuleNumber.html">Wolfram 1-d Rules</a>, but 
with one major change.&nbsp; The cell's new value is XORed with the cell's value from two generations back 
(in other words, the new color should be inverted whenever the cell was 
black two generations back). 
<p>
Intuitively, the cell's rules are symmetric when turned upside down. 
For example, in one-dimension: if the cell is 1 two generation back, 
and the cell and its neighbors are 111 in the previous generation, 
then this might be mapped to a 0.  In that case, the upside down rule 
would be 0 and 111 maps to 1.  Visually, 
<pre>
    1                                            0  
if 111 is a rule, then this must also be a rule 111.
    0                                            1  
</pre>
Although derived from the <a href="WolframRuleNumber.html">Wolfram 1-d Rules</a>, the patterns can be strikingly 
different. Wolfram Rules tend to have triangles oriented up and down, 
while these rules have triangles on their sides. These rules also create 
interesting checkerboards and other mesmerizing patterns.
As examples, try rules 18 and 90, with blank initial states. Draw 
a random pattern on the second row, and run.
