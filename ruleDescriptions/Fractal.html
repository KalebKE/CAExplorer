<b> Fractal Average.</b>
</p>
<p>
Generates Mandelbrot and Julia fractals from a CA that uses complex numbers as values for each cell. 
<p>
The CA rule is simple and is nothing more than a recasting of the "Average" rule.  
Each cell is f(a) where "a" is the average of the cell 
and its neighbors.  The function f is "i tan(z)" by default, but may be reset 
in the "More Properties" window to other complex functions like f = i sin, (i+1) cos, i sinh, (i+1) tanh, etc. 
<p>
At first pass, this rule looks nearly the same as <a href="FractalIteration.html">Fractal No Neighbor</a>.  
However, for a very convincing 
demonstration of their difference, try each rule using a 50% random initial state.  This rule has far more 
interesting behavior in that case.
<p>
What is interesting is not the rule but the way in which the cell's are viewed. 
Each cell can be viewed as either the complex modulus (a shaded value that 
depends on the distance from origin) or as a fractal.  Fractals are derived from 
the equation z = z<sup>2</sup> + c where z (the value of the cell) is iterated repeatedly. 
If the value diverges, the cell is given a light (or empty) color.  If the value 
converges, the cell is given a dark (or full) color.  The rate at which it diverges 
determines shades in between -- the faster the divergence then the lighter the color, 
and the slower the divergence then the darker the color. 
<p>
The Mandelbrot set is derived when c is set to the initial value of the cell.  A 
Julia set is derived when c is a fixed value for all cells.  For Julia sets, the 
value of c may be set in the "More Properties" window. 
<p>
Clearly, a relatively simple CA can take fascinating shapes and patterns when
viewed in a "different light" as a fractal.  In fact, that's the real lesson here.

is no one correct way to display a cellular automaton, and different displays may highlight
