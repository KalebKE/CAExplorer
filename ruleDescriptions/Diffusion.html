<b>Diffusion</b>
<p>
Each occupied cell takes a random walk.  The net effect is that a tight ball of 
occupied cells will slowly diffuse.  In fact, careful analysis (and a very large 
grid) shows that this simulation reproduces the heat/diffusion equation:  
&#8706;&#961;/&#8706;t = &#8711;<sup>2</sup>&#961;. 
<p>
How's it work?  Each cell lives in a 2 by 2 Margolus neighborhood.  All of the 
cells in the neighborhood are randomly rearranged.  This conserves particles (or 
"mass"), and no two particles will occupy the same cell (a "Pauli exclusion 
principle").
<p>
The same simulation could be accomplished using a lattice-gas style simulation 
on a regular (non-Margolus) lattice.
