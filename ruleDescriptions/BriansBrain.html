Similar to Life, this rule generates gliders and complex patterns.  There are three states: 0 = ready, 1 = firing, and 2 = dying.  A cell in the ready state is converted to a cell in the firing state if 
exactly two neighbors are in the firing state. A firing cell is always converted to the dying state (it only gets to fire once, then dies).  A cell in the dying state is always reborn as a ready state (after dying the cell is reborn).

This rule was discovered and popularized by Brian Silverman.
