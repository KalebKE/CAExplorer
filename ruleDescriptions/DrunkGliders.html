<b>Drunk Gliders</b>
<p>
This produces stunning, drunk gliders in a simulation which is 
identical to <a href="Spirals.html">Spirals</a>, but restricted to a 
hexagonal lattice.</p>
<p>
The rule specifies that a cell has 5 states.  A cell in the 0 state 
is converted to a 1 state if there are two, three, or four neighbors in the 
1 state. A cell stays in the 1 state if there are exactly 2 neighbors that 
are also in the 1 state.  If a cell is in the 1 state, but does not have 
exactly 2 neighbors in the 1 state, then the cell slowly begins to die.  At 
each time step the cell's value is incremented until it reaches 4, and then 
at the next time step the cell dies and is converted to a 0. 
<p>This CA is closely aligned with the birth/death process of the
<a href="Life.html">Game of Life</a>.</p>
