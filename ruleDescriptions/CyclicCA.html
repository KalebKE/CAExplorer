<b>Cyclic CA</b>
<p>
Cyclic CA produce spirals and squares that move in a variety of interesting 
ways.  They are frequently used as simplistic models of wave-like behavior, 
particularly "excitable media" which are waves that don't dampen or die away 
over time.  Classic examples include forest fires, waves of people in a football 
stadium, waves of electrical activity moving across the heart, and certain kinds 
of chemical reactions.
<p>
Each cell can only update its state from n to n+1 (modulo N) where N is the number 
of states. In other words, each cell cycles through all possible values.  For 
example, if the the CA has 4 states and the cell is initially in state 0, then 
the cell will perpetually cycle through the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 
<p>
Most importantly, a cell only increments its current state (n) if there are M or 
more neighbors with the next state (n+1).  M is called the trigger number.  <b>The 
trigger number can be set in the "More Properties" panel</b> (it has a default 
value of 3).

Cyclic CA such as these were explored and popularized by David Griffeath.
