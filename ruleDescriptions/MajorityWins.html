<b>Majority Wins</b>
<p>
A model of decision making where a person makes their current opinion
match the majority of their neighbors' opinions (excluding their own opinion).  For example, a cell (or person) will decide to 
join a particular political party only if that party is in the majority (among their neighbors). 
If two neighbors are colored blue and six neighbors are colored red, then the 
cell will decide to join the majority red party. In other words the cell will turn red. If there is a tie, the party is picked randomly.
<p>
This simulation is very sensitive to the initial numbers in each 
of the parties.  Try random populations with 45%, 50%, and 55% 
red cells.  The abrupt change in behavior is modeled by the 
same mathematics that describes phase changes in physics (for 
example, water freezes abruptly at 0 degrees Celsius).  In this case, party affiliations 
change abruptly when crossing over 50%.&nbsp; For details of the behavior and 
the underlying mathematics, see my

class notes</a>.<p>
For fun, try more political parties by changing the number of 
states to 5 or another value.  Watch as one political party 
slowly swallows the other minority parties.
<p>
This is one of a class of so-called voter models that have simple rules but 
surprisingly complex behavior.  These voter models have been used to simulate 
gawking behavior, jury decision making, rioting, herding, flocking, phase transitions (like 
water to ice), and a host of applications in particle physics where molecules check their 
neighboring molecules before moving.
