<b>Minority Wins</b>
<p>

A rebellious model of decision making where a person always chooses to go with the 
minority opinion.  For example, a cell (or person) will decide to 
join a particular political party only if that party is in the minority among their neighbors 
(excluding their own opinion). 
If two neighbors are colored blue and six neighbors are colored red, then the 
cell will decide to join the minority blue party. In other words the cell will turn blue. 
If there is a tie, the party is picked randomly.<p>
This simulation will flip-flop annoyingly as if the cells can never make up their mind. 
While hurtful to the eye, 
this is&nbsp; the way birds behave when standing on the ground in a big flock.&nbsp; 
Each birds is always changing its mind about whether or not they should eat 
or watch for predators.  If all their neighboring birds in the flock are watching for predators 
(like hawks), then they will eat.  
And if all the neighboring birds are eating, then they will decide to watch out 
for predators because nobody else is watching out for them.&nbsp; For more 
information try reading &quot;Bahr, D. B. and M. Bekoff.  1999. Predicting Flock Vigilance From 
Simple Passerine Interactions: Modelling with Cellular Automata. 
<i>Animal Behaviour</i>, 58, 831-839.&quot;<p>
This rule is very similar to Majority Wins, but the cell chooses the minority 
rather than the majority. Understanding this CA will probably be easier after 
studying the Majority Wins CA. As with Majority wins, this CA is very sensitive to the initial 
numbers in each 
of the parties.  Try random populations with 45%, 50%, and 55% 
red cells. 
<p>
To avoid a headache when using two-dimensional grids, try 
averaging 2 time steps. The average boundary behavior is fascinating near the phase change (50% 
red cells). Also try averaging 2, 3, or 4 time steps with 3 states and a 66% initial population.  
The physicists and mathematical sociologists out there will think this is way cool!  
There is some deep behavior being delineated by this averaging.
