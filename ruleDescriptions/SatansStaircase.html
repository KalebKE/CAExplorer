<b>Satan's Staircase.</b>
<p>Three-dimensional fractal staircases made from inverted triangles. This 
CA is rule number 4067213884as outlined in <a href="RuleNumber.html">
RuleNumber</a>. </p>
<p>The inverted triangles are classic class III suggesting that the ultimate 
behavior of this CA is random and chaotic.</p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram divided all CA into behavioral classifications I, II, III, 
and IV. Class I may have transient behavior but eventually settles down to a 
single homogeneous state. Class II evolves into simple repetitive structures. 
Class III exhibits random and chaotic behaviors -- there may be some localized 
structure, but the overall pattern is complex and unpredictable. Class IV 
exhibit complex structures that are neither repetitive nor entirely random and 
may be capable of universal computation.&nbsp; In other words, class IV CA may 
be capable of anything that can be calculated by any other computer -- it's just 
a matter of interpreting the results correctly.&nbsp; Class IV CA are not rare, 
but they are the least common of the four classifications. For more information
