<b>Snowflake</b>
<p>
This is outer totalistic rule 846 which produces a snowflake when 
started from a <b>single seed</b>. A hexagonal lattice works particularly 
well. 
<p>
Many other outer totalistic rules also produce snowflakes.  To try them, 
select the <a href="OuterTotalistic.html">Outer Totalistic</a> rule and enter a rule number. Even numbers 
work best.
