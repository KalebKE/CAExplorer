<b>Snowflake Maze</b>
<p>
This is outer totalistic rule 750 which produces patterns that are a cross 
between a snowflake and a maze. A single seed produces a snowflake that 
morphs into a maze.  Random initial conditions immediately produce a maze. 
<p>
Under what conditions is there a path through the maze from one side to the 
other? Or from the middle to an edge? These are open questions, but we 
could use "percolation" theory to address these.
<p>
Other outer totalistic rules near 750 also produce mazes.  To try them, 
select the <a href="OuterTotalistic.html">Outer Totalistic</a> rule and enter a rule number near 750.  Even 
numbers work best, and some may require a line of 2, 3, 4 or more cells 
as an initial condition.  Try rule 754 with a square (8 neighbor) lattice 
and with three cells in the middle.
