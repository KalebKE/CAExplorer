<b>Minority Wins (with self)</b>

<p>Very similar to <a href="MinorityWins.html">Minority Wins</a>, but in this case the cell itself is included in the
calculation. This is a rebellious model of decision making where a person
always chooses to go with the minority opinion (their own opinion is included
in the count). For example, a cell (or person) will decide to join a particular
political party only if that party is in the minority among their neighbors. If
two neighbors are colored blue, six neighbors are colored red, and the cell
itself is red, then the cell will decide to join the minority blue party. In
other words the cell will turn blue. (If there is a tie, the party is picked
randomly.) </p>

<p>This simulation will flip-flop annoyingly as if the cells can never make up
their mind. While hurtful to the eye, this is&nbsp; the way birds behave when
standing on the ground in a big flock.&nbsp; Each birds is always changing its
mind about whether or not they should eat or watch for predators. If all their
neighboring birds in the flock are watching for predators (like hawks), then
they will eat. And if all the neighboring birds are eating, then they will
decide to watch out for predators because nobody else is watching out for
them.&nbsp; For more information try reading &quot;Bahr, D. B. and M. <span

Passerine Interactions: <span class=SpellE>Modelling</span> with Cellular
Automata. <i>Animal <span class=SpellE>Behaviour</span></i>, 58, 831-839.&quot;</p>

<p>This rule is very similar to <a href="MajorityWinsWithSelf.html">Majority
Wins (with self)</a>, but the cell chooses the minority rather than the
majority. Understanding this CA will probably be easier after studying the
Majority Wins (with self) CA.</p>

<p>Simulations with this rule will very quickly come to a steady state with
obvious clusters of opinion.&nbsp; This simulation is not as interesting as the
strict <a href="MinorityWins.html">Minority Wins</a> rule which excludes the
opinion of the cell from the decision making.&nbsp; In that case, the cell is
entirely influenced by its neighbors, and its own opinion matters not at
all.&nbsp; <span style='color:red'>Simulations with the Minority Wins rule have
more dynamic boundaries than this rule </span>(where the cell cannot quite make
up its mind).</p>

<p>To avoid a headache when using two-dimensional grids, try averaging 2 time
steps. </p>
