<b>Rule 30 (Random # Generator).</b>
<p>
A very simple one-dimensional 2-state rule that can be used to generate random 
numbers.&nbsp; Every statistical test applied to this rule shows that it has 
chaotic and random behavior.&nbsp; For example, random numbers could be constructed by 
collecting a series of bits down the middle of the simulation as shown in red 
below.&nbsp;

The first time step gives a bit of 1 (the initial seed), the second time 
step gives a bit of 1, the third time step gives a bit of 0, etc. Putting them 
together from right to left, we get the sequence of bits 00111011 which is the number 
59.&nbsp; Grabbing the 
next 8 bits gives another number.&nbsp; This process can continue and will 
generate a sequence of random numbers.&nbsp; To try this yourself, use the 
Randomness Test analysis and place the red cursor on the center cell as shown 
above.<p>
For more information see the paper by Stephen Wolfram, 1986, &quot;Random Sequence 
Generation by Cellular Automata&quot;, <i>Advances in Applied Mathematics</i>, vol. 
7, pp. 123-169.<p>
The &quot;30&quot; 
comes from a cellular automata numbering scheme popularized by Stephen Wolfram.&nbsp; 
For details, see <a href="WolframRuleNumber.html">Wolfram 1-d Rules</a>.&nbsp; 
In essence, Rule 30 has the following mapping<ul>
		<li>111 -&gt; <font color="#FF0000">0</font></li>
		<li>110 -&gt; 0</li>
		<li>101 -&gt; 0</li>
		<li>100 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>011 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>010 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>001 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>000 -&gt; <font color="#00FFFF">0</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p>In other words, if the cell and its neighbors are 111, then at the 
		next time step the cell will become a 0.&nbsp; If the cell and its 
		neighbors are 110, then at the next time step the cell will become a 0.&nbsp; 
		Etc.&nbsp; All total, this corresponds to the binary number
		<font color="#FF0000">0</font>001111<font color="#00FFFF">0</font> which 
		is the number 30 in decimal.</p>

Curious about other rule numbers? You can specify any Wolfram rule number by selecting 
and running the &quot;Wolfram 1-d Rule&quot; in the Rule tab.
