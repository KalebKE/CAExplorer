<b>Obesity</b>
<p>
Simulates the evolution of an individual's body mass index (BMI) based on the BMI 
of other members of your social network.  (The following gives a quick description 
of the rule's behavior, but there is also a 
<a href="http://academic.regis.edu/dbahr/GeneralPages/CellularAutomata/CA_Explorer/helpVersion5_0/CA_ObesityTour.html">
brief and basic tutorial</a> on the mechanics of running the Obesity rule, geared towards folks studying obesity.)
<p>
Each state
in the model represents a range of body mass index BMI. Generally, there are 4 states
representing underweight (0), normal (1), overweight (2), and obese (3). In
this model, each person (grid cell) looks at all of their friends (their social 
network defined by the lattice) and is assigned a
probability of taking a new state based on the percentage of their friends that
have that state. The individual is included as a member of their own network.<p>
For example, suppose an individual or a grid cell in the simulation has 8 
friends. Then the probabilities of taking on states 0, 1, 2, or 3 are based on 
the observed states of 9 individuals (8 friends plus the cell itself). If there are four 0's, two 1's, and three 4's,
then the odds are 4/9 that the cell becomes a 0, 2/9 that the cell becomes a
1, and 3/9 that the cell becomes a 4.
 <p>
There is no restriction to 4 categories of BMI. The number of states can 
be increased or decreased to represent any number of categories of BMI. 
Large numbers of states like 100 effectively represent a continuum.
<p>
This simulation is similar to &quot;<a href="MajorityProbablyWins.html">Majority 
Probably Wins</a>&quot;, but includes many more parameters available in the More Properties panel.
Additional parameters include temperature (social volatility), social forces, several types of noise, etc.
<p>
A manuscript detailing results from this model (and its variants) has been accepted and will be 
published in the journal <i>Obesity</i> (<a href="http://www.nature.com/oby/index.html">http://www.nature.com/oby/index.html</a>). 
The anticipated publication date is early 2009. The abstract is below.<p>

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Despite significant efforts, obesity continues to be a 
major public health problem, and there are surprisingly few effective strategies 
for its prevention and treatment. We now realize that healthy diet and activity 
patterns are difficult to maintain in the current physical environment. 
Recently, it was suggested that the social environment also contributes to 
obesity. Therefore, using network-based interaction models, we simulate how 
obesity spreads along social networks and predict the effectiveness of 
large-scale weight management interventions. For a wide variety of conditions 
and networks, we show that individuals with similar BMIs will cluster together 
into groups, and if left unchecked, current social forces will drive these 
groups toward increasing obesity. Our simulations show that many traditional 
weight management interventions fail because they target overweight and obese 
individuals without consideration of their surrounding cluster and wider social 
network. The popular strategy of dieting with friends is shown to be an 
ineffective long-term weight-loss strategy, whereas dieting with friends of 
friends can be somewhat more effective by forcing a shift in cluster 
boundaries. Fortunately, our simulations also show that interventions targeting 
well-connected and/or normal weight individuals at the edges of a cluster may 
quickly halt the spread of obesity. Furthermore, by changing social forces and 
altering the behavior of a small but random assortment of both obese and normal 
weight individuals, highly effective network-driven strategies can reverse 
current trends and return large segments of the population to a healthier 
weight. </p>
