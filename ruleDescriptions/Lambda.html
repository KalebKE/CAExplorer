<p>
A rule that changes from ordered to chaotic behavior by adjusting a slider.

<p>
With 2 nearest neighbors and 2 states, there are 256 possible 
cellular automata rules.  With 2 nearest neighbors and 3 
states, there are 7,625,597,484,987 rules. With 2 nearest 
neighbors and 4 states, there are over 10<sup>154</sup> rules! It is 
impossible to explore all of these rules separately.  Therefore, 
Chris Langton and others created &#955; which varies from 0 to 1. All 
of the rules are represented in that continuum.  Choose a value of 
&#955; and you get one of the many possible rules. 
<p>
Roughly, &#955; is a measure of the number of neighborhood 
configurations that map to 0 (or some other "quiescent" state). 
For example in the binary rule 102, the configuration 011 maps 
to 0, 110 maps to 0, and 101 maps to 0.  Therefore 3 out of 8 
possible configurations map to 0, giving a &#955; value of 3/8 or 
0.375.
Many different cellular automata may have &#955; = 0.375, so the 
mapping is not unique.  By convention, one of the many possible 
rules is chosen randomly. 
<p>
Notice that the behavior changes from ordered to chaotic as &#955; 
increases. 
Changes in &#955; force the CA through phase transitions that move between Wolfram's

behavioral classes I, II, IV, and III</a> (in that order).&nbsp; It's an 
interesting exercise to try and find the value (or values) of &#955; that corresponds 
to class IV, the most complex behavior that may be universal.
