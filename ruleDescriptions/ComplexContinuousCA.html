<p><b>Continuous CA</b></p>
<p>Amazingly &quot;discrete&quot; behavior emerging from cells with complex  
numbers (with &quot;continuous&quot; fractional values).&nbsp; This CA appears capable of 
mimicking many integer-valued CA, 
including many of the one-dimensional <a href="WolframRuleNumber.html">Wolfram Rules</a> 
with their characteristic upside down triangles. This rule is also very similar to the 
real-valued <a href="ContinuousCA.html">Continuous CA</a>.</p>
<p>Each cell is averaged with all of its neighbors.&nbsp; The average x is 
converted to y = m x + b for some slope m and intercept b.&nbsp; Then, only the 
fractional part of y is kept. In other words, think of the complex number y in polar 
coordinates.  The cell is assigned the same angle (complex arg), but only the fractional 
part of the magnitude (complex modulus) is kept.  The result is a cell value that always 
lies within the unit circle.</p>
<p>Be sure to open the More Properties box and adjust the slope and intercept.&nbsp; 
Try many values to get a sense of the possible behaviors. Notice 
that the behaviors encompass all of the Wolfram classes I, II, III, and IV.</p>
