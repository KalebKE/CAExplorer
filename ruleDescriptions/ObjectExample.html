<b>Object Average</b>
<p>
Finds the average of a cell and all of its neighbors.
<p>
This rule uses java objects rather than integers or real numbers to store the cell values. 
The rule was written as an example for developers who wish to write their own 
cellular automaton rules for this program. (It is similar to the 
<a href="ExampleAverage.html">Average</a> rule, but uses 
different code to illustrate a different way to write a rule.)
