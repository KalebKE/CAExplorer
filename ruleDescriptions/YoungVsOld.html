<b>Young Versus Old Diamonds</b>
<p>
Generates ever-changing beautifully colored diamonds that grow from small seeds.
<p>
Similar to <a href="Life.html">Life</a> and <a href="CyclicCA.html">Cyclic CA</a>, each cell is born, survives, or dies.
The births and deaths depend on the number of neighbors that 
have a larger value than the cell (younger) and the 
number of neighbors that have a smaller value than the cell (older). 
<p>
A cell is &quot;born&quot; if it is currently unoccupied (has value 0) and if there are two or 
more neighbors that are greater than 0. It is born with a value one 
higher than the highest valued neighbor.
For example, consider a cell with 8 neighbors as shown.
<pre>
     653
     305
     000
</pre>
The cell in the middle will be "born" at the next time step with a value 
of 7 because 6 is the largest value in the neighborhood.
On the other hand, 
<pre>
     008
     000
     000
</pre>
will not birth because there is only one neighbor greater than 0 (at least two are needed). 
Likewise
<pre>
     653
     325
     000
</pre>
will not birth because the middle cell is not a 0.
<p>
A cell will "die" if the number of older neighbors is greater than the number of younger 
neighbors. The cell itself is included as a younger neighbor, 
and neighbors with value 0 are not counted as either younger or older).
