<b>Fireworks</b>
<p>
A fun rule that looks like fireworks when started from a single seed. 
This rule is similar to Life, but a cell births whenever the sum of its  
neighbors is even (up to a maximum of 200), and a cell dies whenever the 
sum of its neighbors is odd (up to a maximum of 201). 
<p>
Cells can have value 0 to 50.
Only cells that have state 1 are counted as "alive".  When a cell 
dies, it slowly fades away by cycling through the higher valued 
states.  Once the highest state is reached, the cell is set to state 
0.  These higher valued states take space on the grid, but they do 
not count as alive neighbors.
