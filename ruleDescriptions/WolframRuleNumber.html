<b>Wolfram 1-d Rules</b>
<p>
The classic binary rules numbered by Stephen Wolfram's scheme. 
<p>
Consider a triplet of sites formed by the left neighbor, the cell 
itself, and the right neighbor.  Let each black cell be a 1 and  
each white cell be a 0. Each possible value for the triplet 
is mapped to particular bits. For example, 000 might map to 0, 
001 to 1, 010 to 1, 011 to 0, 100 to 0, 101 to 1, 110 to 1, and 
111 to 0. Taken in order from 111 to 000, the triplets correspond 
to 01100110 or the number 102. The number of possible rules is 
2^(2^3), or 2^8, or 256.  My class notes contain more examples of

constructing these rule numbers</a>.
<p>
These 256 CA have been studied in great detail and some of the results are 
fascinating, especially for mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists.  
For example, rule 110 is "universal" and capable of computing anything that a desktop 
computer can calculate! You just have to interpret the results in exactly the 
right way. And in my class we explore rule 102's mathematics in gory detail (both the CA 
and it's math are quite beautiful, I think). See
