<b>Rule 102.</b>
<p>
Calculates the sum modulo N of a cell and its neighbor to the right. The &quot;102&quot; 
comes from a cellular automata numbering scheme popularized by Stephen Wolfram 
(see <a href="WolframRuleNumber.html">Wolfram 1-d Rules</a>).
<p>
On a one-dimensional (2 neighbor) lattice with a single initial state of value 1, 
this is a modulo N version of Pascal's triangle.  Large
grids (e.g., 500 X 500) are slow but can produce beautiful fractal
patterns.
