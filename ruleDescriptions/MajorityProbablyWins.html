<b>Majority Probably Wins</b>
</p>
<p>
A model of decision making where folks probably base their current opinion
on their neighbors' previous opinions.  For example, a cell (or person) might decide to 
join a particular political party with a probability that is based on the 
number of neighbors that are already in that party. If two neighboring cells are colored 
blue and six neighboring cells are colored red, then the odds 
are 6/8 that the cell becomes blue and 2/8 that the cell becomes 
red.

<p> 
This rule is very similar to Majority Wins, but this one adds a probabilistic component.  
Understanding this CA will probably be easier after studying the Majority Wins CA.&nbsp;

This is one of a class of so-called voter models that have simple rules but 
surprisingly complex behavior.  These voter models have been used to simulate 
gawking behavior, jury decision making, rioting, herding, flocking, phase transitions (like 
water to ice), and a host of applications in particle physics where molecules check their 
neighboring molecules before moving.
