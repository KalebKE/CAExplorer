<b>Q2R Ising (Jiggly Water Balloon)</b>

What? Jiggly water balloon? Will such a name make dead physicists roll over in 
their grave? No, hang with me to the end, and I'll explain. Just like the Ising model, this is a simulation of the way clusters of magnetism 
or &quot;magnetic domains&quot; form and move around in an iron bar. For more information about the underlying 
physics, first read about the <a href="IsingModel.html">Ising Model</a> rule. A rough 
understanding the Ising model will facilitate an understanding of this rule (and 
vice-versa). But as a simple starter, just remember that each cell more-or-less represents a 
tiny atomic-sized magnet that spins like a top and points either up or down (has 
a value 0 or 1). We get magnets when all or most of the spins are pointing in 
the same direction.<p>A cell in an Ising model will flip its spin (change values) 
whenever that flip minimizes energy. See the <a href="IsingModel.html">Ising Model</a> 
rule for details about energy, but for now, remember that there is a unit of energy 
whenever two adjacent spins are opposite (an up-spin next to a down-spin). If we 
visualize each spin as an arrow, then we can imagine that the top of each 
neighboring arrow is connected by a spring. When two adjacent arrows are 
pointing in the same direction, then the spring is relaxed. But when the 
adjacent arrows are pointing in opposite directions, then the spring is under 
tension, and there is a resulting unit of potential energy (that can be released 
and minimized if the spin flips).</p>
<p>By contrast, a cell in the Q2R model will only flip if such a 
change exactly conserves energy. The cellular automaton rule is &quot;always flip if 
surrounded by an equal number of 0's and 1's, and never flip under any other 
circumstances.&quot; In other words, the cell will flip only if it 
has an equal number of neighbors with spin up and spin down. In other words, the 
spring tension (and energy) is the same no matter which way the arrow points, so 
the arrow can flip without changing the energy. Therefore, the Q2R model conserves 
energy at a microscopic scale (the scale of our tiny atomic-sized magnets). For that reason, the Q2R model is called 
&quot;microcanonical&quot;. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Ising model conserves energy, but only on a 
macroscopic scale by keeping the whole simulation at a constant temperature with it's 
surroundings (as if the model has been sunk into a nice warm fixed-temperature 
bathtub or &quot;heat bath&quot;). So energy in an Ising model is conserved only &quot;on average&quot;, 
and the Ising model is called &quot;canonical&quot;.&nbsp; In short, &quot;microcanonical&quot; 
= fixed energy and a fixed number of particles (little tiny magnets in our 
case); &quot;canonical&quot; = variable energy but fixed number of particles; and in case 
you are curious, &quot;grand canonical&quot; = variable energy and a variable number of 
particles. FYI, in a &quot;canonical&quot; system, temperature and heat baths are 
introduced as a way to control the variable energy.</p>
<p>



Ok, so why the name &quot;jiggly water balloon&quot;? Run the Q2R model for a 
while, and you'll notice that the number of 1's and 0's changes with time. There 
are fixed number of cells or particles (i.e., a fixed number of tiny 
atomic-sized magnets), but their spin can change and be up (0) or down (1). So 
in this microcanonical case, 
the number of 1's and 0's are not conserved. However, the <i>length of the 
boundary</i> between the 1's and 0's <i>is conserved</i>. The boundary is a 
visual representation of where all the energy is kept and conserved in the system. You can see 
this very easily by creating a symmetric shape, like a &quot;filled circle&quot; or water 
balloon, and watching it evolve over time. The balloon will jiggle like a bowl 
full of jelly and the boundary will deform, but the length of the boundary 
(energy!) remains fixed. Now that's cool! By the way, for fun, try popping the balloon by 
poking it (clicking) with the mouse near it's edge.<p>



Incidentally, the rule is completely deterministic and reversible (it's 
equivalent to a second-order reversible rule -- see my
<a href="http://academic.regis.edu/dbahr/GeneralPages/CellularAutomata/CA_part7_files/frame.htm">
lecture notes</a>). Also, if you start from a random initial state (like 15% 
randomly filled with 1's), then the number of 1's and 0's will quickly 
equilibrate to half of each. To see this, turn on the &quot;Average&quot; analysis and 
notice that the system will evolve to an average value of 0.5. 

<p>
Finally, note that the rule uses a checkerboard lattice pattern as described in the 
<a href="IsingModel.html">Ising Model</a> rule. For additional details see the excellent reference, 
<i>Cellular Automata Machines</i> by Tofoli and Margolus, 1991, Chapter 17.
