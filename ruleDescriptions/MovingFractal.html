<b>Moving Fractal</b>
</p>
<p>
This simulation requires <b>lots</b> of memory and a fast processor, but will evolve 
into the shape of a fractal such as the Mandelbrot set or a Julia set. In EZ mode, it 
won't look like much. For a better display, you will need to set the lattice size much 
larger, but only do this if you a have at least 3GB memory (might crash otherwise).
<p>
Each cell is a vector of complex numbers, with each number "pointing" at a 
particular neighbor.  For example, the 1st element of the vector points at the 1st 
neighbor, the 2nd element points at the second neighbor, etc.  At each time step, 
the numbers move from the cell to their respective neighbors, just like the translation 
step of a lattice gas (see the hexagonal <a href="LatticeGas.html">lattice gas rule</a>).  
After translating, 
each cell holds new complex numbers (vector elements). These complex numbers are 
reoriented so that the element with the largest real value points to the right, the 
smallest real value points to the left, the largest imaginary value points up, and the 
smallest imaginary value points down.  Effectively, this is a lattice gas simulation 
with multiple forces and no collisions (conservation of mass, but not momentum). 
Any element that translates into a wall "bounces back" in the opposite direction. 
<p>
The default view shows the complex modulus (distance from the origin) of the average 
of the elements in the vector.  Darker colors are complex numbers that are farther 
from the origin.  Effectively, the complex numbers migrate to their appropriate 
relative positions on the complex plane, piling up against any walls that are in 
the way. With walls around the edges, the view is darker along the outside because 
the larger numbers migrate outwards and pile against the walls.  The distance at the 
walls is greatest from the origin at the center, so these numbers are darker colors. 
<p>
More interestingly, if the Julia or Mandelbrot view is selected, then the particles 
slowly arrange themselves as fractals.  This will take time and a large simulation. 
The fractal views shade each cell by the amount of time it takes the iterative 
equation z = z<sup>2</sup> + c to diverge where z is the value of the cell.  For Julia sets, c is 
set to a fixed value.  For the Mandelbrot set, c is the initial value of the cell. 
<p>
As with the <a href="Fractal.html">Fractal rule</a>, <b>this simulation illustrates the 
importance of choosing an 
appropriate view for the cell states</b>.  Different views (like the Julia set) can lead 
to radically different interpretations of the same CA rule. To help interpret the 
results, first try the Fractal rule and compare the shapes from that rule to the 
shapes produced by this rule. (Set the center of the Fractal rule at 0+0i with width 3.)
