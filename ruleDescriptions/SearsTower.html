<b>Sears Tower</b>
<p>
Creates an unusual fractal sky scraper. Unlike most CA, this one relies on information 
about the current generation (time step).  In effect, this means that the rule changes 
slightly depending on the generation. In particular, the rule calculates the modified 
sum of a cell and its neighbors using the following formula: 
<pre>
new cell value = (cell + (generation * (sum of neighbors)) % 3) % N 
</pre>
where N is the number of states. Therefore, the same rule repeats every three time steps.
