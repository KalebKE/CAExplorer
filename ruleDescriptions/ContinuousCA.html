<p><b>Continuous CA</b></p>
<p>Amazingly &quot;discrete&quot; behavior emerging from cells with real (&quot;continuous&quot;) 
values.&nbsp; This CA appears capable of mimicking many integer-valued CA, 
including many of the one-dimensional <a href="WolframRuleNumber.html">Wolfram Rules</a> 
with their characteristic upside down triangles.</p>
<p>Each cell is averaged with all of its neighbors.&nbsp; The average x is 
converted to y = m x + b for some slope m and intercept b.&nbsp; Then, only the 
fractional part of y is kept (the whole number part is discarded, in a sort of 
real-valued version of &quot;modulo 1.0&quot;).&nbsp; This is the new value assigned to 
the cell.</p>
<p>Be sure to open the More Properties box and adjust the slope and intercept.&nbsp; 
In particular, to get a sense of the possible behaviors, try m = 1.0 and b = 
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 0.9, 1.0 with a one-dim (2 neighbor) lattice.&nbsp; Notice 
that these encompass all of the Wolfram classes I, II, III, and IV.&nbsp; Also 
try the other suggestions in the More Properties box.</p>
<p>Any integer-valued rule can be 
approximated by a real-valued rule, but Stephen Wolfram in <i>A New Kind of 
Science</i> has further hypothesized that real-valued (or complex, or etc.) 
rules do not confer any additional non-trivial behaviors beyond those already 
created by integer rules.&nbsp; In other words, Wolfram believes that classes I, 
II, III, and IV still apply to rules built from real numbers.&nbsp; At the very 
least, it is interesting to see integer-rule behaviors reproduced so nicely in 
real-valued rules.&nbsp; Or perhaps it's vice-versa.</p>
