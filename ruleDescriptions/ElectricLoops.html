<b>Electric Loops</b>
<p>Ever-changing electric loops that grow, shrink, and sometimes migrate with 
railroad tracks. This is <a href="OuterTotalistic.html">Outer Totalistic</a> 
rule 301 with two states and a running average of 2 to avoid annoying blinking. 
(See <a href="EpilepticBlobs.html">Epileptic Blobs</a> for an explanation of the 
blinking common to so many Outer Totalistic rules.). This CA is similar to
<a href="SuperLoops.html">Super Loops</a>. </p>
<p>Symmetric initial states produce mesmerizing pulsing patterns, while random 
initial states tend to produce colliding railroad tracks.</p>
<p><i>Why are there three colors</i> if there are only two states? The CA 
defaults to a running average of 2 time steps (you can change this if you like).&nbsp;When averaging two values, a 0 and a 0 averages to a 0.&nbsp;A 1 and a 1 
averages to a 1. And a 1 and a 0 averages to a 0.5.&nbsp;The 0.5 is the third 
color.&nbsp;To see the simulation with the original two colors (two states), 
just set the running average to 1.&nbsp;As emphasized in many rules, the manner 
in which a CA is displayed can convey very different information.</p>
