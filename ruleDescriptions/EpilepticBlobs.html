<b>Epileptic Blobs</b>
<p>
Seizure-inducing blobs of alternating color that emerge from a sea of 
randomness. This is outer totalistic rule 429 with two states. The flashing 
behavior is characteristic of many two-state outer-totalistic simulations with 
small rule numbers that end in an 
odd number (in that case, a neighborhood with all 0's is transformed to a 1 and 
anything with lots of 1's is transformed to a 0). To try 
other similar flashing rules, 
select the <a href="OuterTotalistic.html">Outer Totalistic</a> rule, and enter an 
odd rule number.<p>
A running average of 2 is the same as the <a href="SuperLoops.html">Super Loops</a> 
rule. This eliminates the flashing and creates fascinating strings 
and loops that outline the blobs. Try disturbing, erasing, or extending the 
loops by drawing with the mouse. In most cases, the loops quickly recover, 
approximating their original shape. 
However, filling in a concave area on the inside of the loop will make it 
quickly shrink.
