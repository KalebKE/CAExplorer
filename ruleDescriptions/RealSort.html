<p><b>Sort Reals</b></p>
<p>Sorts real numbers by swapping adjacent pairs that are out of order.  Sorts 
until all numbers are in order from left to right. Because wrap-around 
lattices have no fixed starting point, this rule does not allow swaps across 
the boundary. The boundary then acts as a starting point for the sort. 
</p>
<p>
Among other things, sorting is a problem in &quot;mass conservation&quot;. The 
numbers that are in the list must not &quot;disappear&quot; over time. The Margolus 
lattice is often used for problems in physics because it is particularly good at conserving 
quantities like mass.  Likewise, this sorting algorithm uses a Margolus lattice to 
&quot;conserve the numbers&quot;. See the one-dim (Margolus) lattice 
tooltip for more details, but essentially, every pair of numbers is placed within a &quot;block&quot;. 
Numbers within a block are swapped when out of order. 
</p>
<p>
How fast is this sort?  Adjacent pair swapping algorithms are notoriously slow, typically O(N<sup>2</sup>). 
However, CA run in parallel, swapping all blocks simultaneously.  Therefore, this algorithm runs 
exceptionally fast! It is O(N).

<p>
To see the quick run time, select a 99% random initial state on a 200 by 200 lattice. 
On the Controls tab, select the button labeled &quot;><sub>F</sub>&quot;. (This stops the CA after filling the screen.) 
Notice that values migrate across the screen to their correct location, but they will always do so 
within 200 time steps (the maximum time it takes to go all the way across the screen). In fact, running the 
simulation many times will convince you that the average run time is somewhat shorter than O(N).
