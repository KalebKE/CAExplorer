<b>Diffusion Limited Aggregation</b>
<p>
Each occupied cell diffuses by taking a random walk (see the Diffusion rule). 
However, one special state acts as a solid.  Any other state coming into contact 
with a solid will "freeze" into a solid (change state). The net effect is that a 
crystalline solid will slowly grow.  This process is called diffusion limited 
aggregation because the solid's growth (or aggregation) is limited by the areas 
accessible to the diffusing gas.
<p>
Real world examples of this process include frost forming on windows, lightning, 
and certain mineral deposits like this beautiful manganese oxide crystal that 
grew within a piece of Lyons Sandstone in my backyard.<img border="0" src="../images/LyonsSandstone.jpg" width="253" height="189" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4"> 
From personal experience, another example is a freezing LCD laptop monitor in 
the high Canadian arctic (umm, not recommended).
<p>
In all cases, the resulting shape is a beautiful fractal with 
dimension ~1.70 (use the Fractal Box-Counting Dimension Analysis). 
<p>
Although this simulation uses diffusion on a Margolus lattice, the same simulation 
could be accomplished using a lattice-gas style simulation on a regular 
(non-Margolus) lattice.
