<b>Hexagonal Life</b>
<p>
Same as the <a href="Life.html">Game of Life</a> rule, but on a hexagonal lattice. 
See the <a href="Life.html">Life rule description</a> for more details. 
<p>
Cells are either occupied (live) or unoccupied (dead) and evolve according 
to the following rules. 
<ul>
	<li>A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies of loneliness. </li>
	<li>A live cell with 4 or more live neighbors dies of overcrowding. </li>
	<li>A live cell with exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors survives unchanged. </li>
	<li> A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors will come to life (birth).</li>
</ul>
