<b>Totalistic.</b>
</p>
<p>
Beautiful symmetric rules that depend only on the sum of the neighbors and 
the cell itself. When started from a single seed in two dimensions, the 
results are often snowflakes with stunning detail.
<p>
The rule is specified by a code number. For example, consider a one-dimensional 
(2 neighbor) rule with only two states (0 and 1).  If the sum of the cell and neighboring 
values is 3, this might map to a 1. If the sum of the values is 2, then this might map 
to a 1.  If the sum of the values is 1, this might map to a 0.  If the 
sum is 0, this might map to 1.  Altogether (and in that order), these map to 1101,
or in decimal, 13.  This 13 is the "code" for the outer totalistic rule.
