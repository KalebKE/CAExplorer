<b>Ising Model</b>

<p>



A classic model of magnetization much beloved by physicists. Ising models are 
usually implemented as Monte Carlo simulations, but the parallelizable cellular 
automata versions can run much faster.&nbsp;


<p>



So what is it? It's a model of the way clusters of magnetism or &quot;magnetic 
domains&quot; move around in an iron bar. A real iron bar is magnetic when all of 
it's atoms are aligned, and the bar is not magnetic if all of its atoms are 
pointing in random directions (for simplicity sake, I'm taking some liberties 
with the real physics, but we aren't losing anything important). Now imagine 
that every cell in our simulation represents a tiny atomic-sized magnet that 
spins like a top and points either up or down. On a cellular automaton we can 
visualize these as up and down arrows, 0's and 1's, or black and white cells. In 
our simulation we will get a magnet if all or a majority of the atomic-sized 
arrows are aligned in the same direction.<p>



Now imagine that the top of each arrow is attached to each of its neighbors by 
small springs. If two arrows (tiny magnets) are pointing in the same direction 
(both up or both down), then the springs are close together and relaxed.&nbsp; 
But if two magnets have opposite spin (one points up and the other points down), 
then the spring is stretched and under tension. If the spring is under 
tension, then it pulls and wants to relax and minimize energy. Therefore, the 
spin of a cell will want to flip from up to down (or vice-versa) if this puts 
the springs under less tension.


<p>



For example, suppose we have three cells arranged as 101 where the 0's point up 
and the 1's point down. Then the middle cell will want to flip to a 1 because 
this will minimize the tension on the spring (minimize energy). In other words, 
at the next time step the cellular automaton will become 111. In another 
example, we might have 110.&nbsp; In that case, the middle cell can't decide if 
it should be a 1 or a 0. Neither situation will reduce energy because it is 
always out of alignment with at least one of the neighboring cells. In any given 
configuration we can add up all the neighbors that are &quot;out of alignment&quot; and 
subtract the number of neighbors that are &quot;in alignment.&quot; This gives the change 
in energy (&#916;E) that would result if we flipped the 
spin of the cell.<p>



The Ising model always attempts to minimize energy. So a cell will <i>always</i> 
flip spins (change from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa) if this will reduce energy or 
leave it the same. In other words, a flip happens when &#916;E 
&lt;= 0. In any other situation, the cell <i>might-maybe-perhaps</i> flip. If the 
increase in energy is small, then it's more likely to flip than if the increase 
in energy is huge. To be more precise, the flips happen with a probability given 
by an exponential Boltzmann distribution exp[-&#916;E]. 
(See statistical mechanics texts to understand why it's an exponential 
distribution.)<p>



Now if we track the spins over time (i.e., the 0's and 1's in the cellular 
automaton simulation), then we'll see that the spins tend to cluster together 
because that minimizes energy. Over time, the clusters grow and shrink and 
represent domains of magnetization. Cool!<p>



But wait, there's more. Without going into too many details, we can add a few 
important parameters.&nbsp; First, remember that springs come in a variety of 
different stiffness (spring constants). Some springs are really hard to stretch, 
and others are floppy and easy to stretch. We can add this parameter to the 
model as a &quot;spin-spin interaction strength&quot; usually labeled J. This J is a 
measure of the energy required to move two spins out of alignment. With stiff 
springs (high J), it's really hard to move those spins out of alignment. When J 
is positive we get standard ferromagnets where the spins prefer to remain 
aligned. If we change J to a negative value, then we get anti-ferromagnets where 
the spins try to arrange themselves into a checkerboard like pattern. Try it! In 
the simulation, go to the More Properties panel and play with the slider that 
adjusts J -- you can see the change in behavior from ferromagnet to 
anti-ferromagnet.<p>



We can also add temperature, T. If you take a magnet and put it under a blow 
torch, the magnet heats up until it passes the Curie point and loses its 
magnetism. This sudden change from magnet to non-magnet is called a phase 
transition. In the model, temperature changes the Boltzmann distribution so that 
it is exp[-&#916;E/(kT)] where k is the Boltzmann 
constant. Notice the negative sign in -&#916;E? This puts 
the exponential in the denominator and means that as T increases, the 
probability of flipping gets higher and higher. Eventually at a high enough 
temperature, the cells flip values randomly and all of the time -- the domains 
of magnetization disappear. And at very low temperatures, the probability goes 
to zero and the cells freeze into place -- they never flip.&nbsp; To get a 
better feel for this, try it in the simulation. Go to the More Properties panel 
and play with the slider that adjusts T.<p>



Finally, we can also add an external magnetic field, B. This is like putting a 
small bar magnet right next to your computer's hard drive -- zap! The bar magnet 
makes all of the &quot;cells&quot; on your hard drive flip (and you have reset your hard 
drive losing all of your data). In the model, the change in energy is adjusted 
by the external magnetic field. Just add B to &#916;E. 
This biases the flips. Again, you can try this in the simulation by going to the 
More Properties panel and adjusting the slider for B.<p>



Well, that's a pretty basic introduction, but hundreds of papers about the Ising 
model are published every year, so there are many excellent references. I 
suggest <a href="http://oscar.cacr.caltech.edu/Hrothgar/Ising/intro.html">
this link</a> as a nice and easy 
description that includes some of the mathematics at a basic level. Many more 
details can be found in statistical mechanics texts.

By the way, writing code for a cellular automaton version of an Ising model has 
a few wrinkles. Most importantly, because all cells are updated in parallel (at 
the same time) we can inadvertently cause a non-physical oscillation. For 
example, consider the scenario 1001. With wrap-around boundary conditions, each 
cell sees that it has &#916;E = 0 and flips. The result is 
0110. But at the next time step, it flips back, and then continues to oscillate 
indefinitely. Oops. The problem is that the calculation of &#916;E 
assumes that the neighbors remained unchanged at the next time step, but in the 
model both the neighbors and the cells are updating at the same time. To prevent 
this behavior, we use a von Neumman lattice (four nearest neighbors) and divide 
the lattice into a checkerboard pattern. Then we only update half of the cells 
at each time step. First we update the &quot;red&quot; checkerboard cells, and then at the 
next time step we update the &quot;black&quot; checkerboard cells. This keeps neighbors 
from overlapping and prevents the oscillation. For details on similar mechanical 
details, I highly recommend reading <i>Cellular Automata Machines</i> by Tofoli 
and Margolus, 1991, Chapter 17.<p>



Finally, a phenomenological observation. Notice the <i>many</i> similarities in behavior 
between Ising models and <a href="MajorityWins.html">Majority Wins</a> style rules. 
In both, we see clustering into domains, phase changes, etc. For example, the use of temperature in the 
<a href="ObesityModel.html">Obesity</a> rule (a modified majority wins rule) is 
nearly identical with only slightly mathematical differences. As illustrated in 
my
<a href="http://academic.regis.edu/dbahr/GeneralPages/CellularAutomata/CA_part17_files/frame.htm">
lecture notes</a>, the same type of statistical mechanical arguments apply to 
both cellular automata.
