<b>Water Skimmers</b>
<p>Flashing skimmeres that leave ripples on a pond. Each cell is a real value between 0.0 and 1000.0.&nbsp; 
Values of the cell and 
neighbors are averaged together, and a small random amount is added at each time 
step.&nbsp; The result is taken &quot;modulo&quot; the maximum real value (1000.0).</p>
<p>On large lattices, be patient while waiting for the skimmers to appear.</p>
