<b>Super Loops</b>
<p>String-like loops emerging from a sea of randomness. This is the same rule as
<a href="EpilepticBlobs.html">Epileptic Blobs</a> (outer totalistic rule 429 
with two states), but the flashing 
behavior of Epileptic Blobs is eliminated by adding a running average of 2. The 
blobs are outlined by the loops. </p>
<p>Try disturbing, erasing, or extending the 
loops by drawing with the mouse. In most cases, the loops quickly recover, 
approximating their original shape. However, filling in a concave area on the 
inside of the loop will make it quickly shrink.</p>
<p><i>Why are there three colors</i> if there are only two states? The CA uses a running average of 2 time steps.&nbsp;When averaging two values, a 0 and a 0 averages to a 0.&nbsp; A 1 and a 1 
averages to a 1. And a 1 and a 0 averages to a 0.5.&nbsp;The 0.5 is the third 
color.&nbsp;To see the simulation with the original two colors (two states), run 
Epileptic Blobs and set the running average to 1.&nbsp;The difference is 
remarkable. As emphasized in many rules, the manner 
in which a CA is displayed can convey very different information.</p>
