<b>Growing Seed</b>
<p>
A rule that spreads relentlessly from an initial cell. Each cell always increments by a value of 1 unless it is a 0.  
A cell that is 0 will increment only if it has a non-zero neighbor.  When a cell's value reaches the maximum number 
of states, it is reset to 0 (in other words, all values are modulo the number of states).
<p>
This rule works well with the Target Image analysis.
