<b>Real Spirals</b>
<p>Striking spirals that are very similar to other spiral rules that use integer 
values.&nbsp; In this case, each cell is a real value between 0.0 and 1000.0.&nbsp; 
Cells always increase in value by 10.0, but they increase by 20.0 if surrounded 
by 2 or more neighbors with larger values. The result is taken &quot;modulo&quot; the maximum real value (1000.0).</p>
<p>This CA is very similar to many <a href="CyclicCA.html">Cyclic CA</a> that 
create spirals from integers.&nbsp; In fact, any integer-valued rule can be 
approximated by a real-valued rule, but Stephen Wolfram in <i>A New Kind of 
Science</i> has further hypothesized that real-valued (or complex, or etc.) 
rules do not confer any additional non-trivial behaviors beyond those already 
created by integer rules.&nbsp; In other words, Wolfram believes that classes I, 
II, III, and IV still apply to rules built from real numbers.&nbsp; At the very 
least, it is interesting to see integer-rule behaviors reproduced so nicely in 
real-valued rules.&nbsp; Or perhaps it's vice-versa.</p>
