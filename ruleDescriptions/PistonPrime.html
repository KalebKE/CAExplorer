<b>Piston Prime</b>
<p>
Similar to Life but not as dynamic and ending in "still lifes" with 
occasional piston-like shapes.  Cells are born if they have exactly 
3 "alive" neighbors.  They survive if they have a prime number of 
neighbors. Otherwise they die. 
<p>
Only cells that have state 1 are counted as "alive".  When a cell 
dies, it slowly fades away by cycling through the higher valued 
states.  Once the highest state is reached, the cell is set to state 
0.  These higher valued states take space on the grid, but they do 
not count as alive neighbors. 
<p>
<b>Note</b> that this is the same rule as <a href="PrimePlague.html">Prime Plague</a> which has 
13 states on an twelve-neighbor triangular lattice. This rule has 4 
states on an eight-neighbor square lattice. The difference in behavior 
is dramatic.
