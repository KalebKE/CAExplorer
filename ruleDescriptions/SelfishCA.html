<b>Mostly Selfish.</b>
</p>
<p>
The neighbors are used to determine what rule is applied to each cell. Each
set of neighbors defines a rule number (a la Wolfram -- see the 
<a href="WolframRuleNumber.html">Wolfram
1-d Rule</a>). This rule number then dictates the cell's next value. CA that 
use their neighbors to determine the applicable rule are called "selfish" CA.  
</p>
<p>
In particular, this rule looks at the nearest neighbors and the cell
(in between them) to get an integer value. For example, the neighbors and the
cell might be 110, which is the number 6. Then starting from the neighbor on
the far right, it moves left on the lattice that number of spaces. In other
words, with 110, it moves left 6 spaces. If it tries to move further left
than the number of neighbors, then it wraps around to the rightmost neighbor.
So if the lattice is nearest neighbor, then 110 moves 6 spaces left but wraps
around twice and ends on the 0. Whatever value it ends on is the new value of
the cell.
</p>
<p>
Other selfish CA have a lattice of length (width) 8 and a rule number 
is constructed from the entire lattice.  Therefore, the rule changes once per 
time step and applies to all cells.  I call this rule "mostly selfish" to distinguish 
it from these length 8 selfish CA.

<p>
For the nearest-neighbor lattice, this is the same as rule 168. The most
interesting behavior is on a next-nearest neighbor lattice.
