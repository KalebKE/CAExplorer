Similar to the <a href="Q2RIsingModel.html">Q2R Ising (Jiggly Water Balloon)</a> rule, but with three states. Each state is mapped to 
-1, 0, and 1 by subtracting one from each cell. The neighbors are summed, and when the sum is zero, the state flips to the negative of 
its current value. (This is the same as finding the change in energy in the Q2R model, and flipping the 
spin when the change is zero.) Then one is added to each cell so that it is mapped back to the values 0, 1, and 2.
A checkerboard von Neumann lattice is used, as with the Ising models.
