<p><b>Complex Life</b></p>
<p>Amazingly <a href="Life.html">Life</a>-like behavior emerging from cells with complex (&quot;continuous&quot;) 
values.&nbsp; Try starting from a random initial configuration and watch blinkers, gliders and 
other symmetric and stable life-forms evolve.</p>
<p>Each cell takes the average x of itself and its neighbors, then plugs x into the equation 
y = m x<sup>2</sup> + b for some slope m and intercept b.&nbsp; Only the 
fractional part of y is kept.  In other words, think of the complex number y in polar 
coordinates.  The cell is assigned the same angle (complex arg), but only the fractional 
part of the magnitude (complex modulus) is kept.  The result is a cell value that always 
lies within the unit circle. </p>
<p>
Finally, the absolute value of the real component is used.  
In other words, all cells get mapped to values in the positive real portion of the unit circle. This is 
not strictly necessary, and similar life-like behavior is possible without the absolute value (for example, 
at values m = 0.9 + 0.9i, and b = 0.312 + 1.0 i).  However, the absolute value gives more interesting gliders.</p>
<p>Life-like behavior happens when the slope m = 0.9 + 0.9 i and the y-intercept
 b = 0.39 + 0.98 i. The behavior is very sensitive to changes in these values.  Changes may 
cause life to proliferate too rapidly or to die off to quickly. (Values may be adjusted in 
the More Properties panel.)</p>
<p>Note that this life-like behavior is only visible when cells are color-coded by their 
rate of divergence from the Mandelbrot set (in other words, the standard color coding for 
displaying Mandelbrot sets).  Dark colors are on the Mandelbrot set, and increasingly light 
colors are diverging more rapidly from the set.  In other words, colors are derived from 
the equation z = z<sup>2</sup> + c where z (the value of the cell) is iterated repeatedly. 
If the value diverges, the cell is given a light (or empty) color.  If the value 
converges, the cell is given a dark (or full) color.  The rate at which it diverges 
determines shades in between -- the faster the divergence then the lighter the color, 
and the slower the divergence then the darker the color. See the <a href="Fractal.html">Fractal</a> 
rule for another example of this 
coloring scheme.</p>
<p> Note that if the cells are instead shaded by their complex modulus (distance from 
the origin), then the display shows nothing but a blank screen. <b>There 
is no one correct way to display a cellular automaton, and different displays may highlight 
otherwise hidden information.</b> In this case, the Mandelbrot set reveals all.</p>
