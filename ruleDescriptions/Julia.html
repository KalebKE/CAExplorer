<b>Chinese Dragon (Julia Tornado).</b>
<p>
A phantasmagorical fractal display that comes from a surprisingly boring CA. 
The CA simply averages the complex number values of neighboring 
cells.  But to create a display, the equation z = z<sup>2</sup> + c is 
iterated repeatedly where c is the cell's value, and z is the 
cell's position on the complex plane (each cell is assigned a 
position on the complex plane that corresponds to it's lattice 
position). If the value diverges, the cell is given a light (or 
empty) color.  If the value converges, the cell is given a dark 
(or full) color.  The rate at which it diverges determines shades 
in between -- the faster the divergence then the lighter the color, 
and the slower the divergence then the darker the color.
<p>
To add interest, a small complex number is added to the cells at 
each generation.  The value cycles sinusoidally between 0.001+0.001i 
and -0.001-0.001i every 400 generations. The net effect is that the 
CA displays slightly different Julia sets at each generation.  The 
equation z = z<sup>2</sup> + c produces a different Julia set for each value 
of c. 
<p>
This CA is a wonderful example of how the display makes a huge 
difference in interpretation.  In this case, the cell values are 
interpreted as belonging to Julia sets.  <b>There 
is no one correct way to display a cellular automaton, and different 
displays may highlight otherwise hidden information.</b>
