<b>Colliding Cyclones</b></p>
<p>
This CA produces spiraling cyclones. 
<p>
Each cell can only update its state from n to n+1 (modulo N) where N is the number 
of states. In other words, each cell cycles through all possible values.  Also, a 
cell only increments its current state (n) if there are 3 or more neighbors with 
the next state (n+1).
<p>
Cyclic CA such as this one were explored and popularized by David Griffeath.
