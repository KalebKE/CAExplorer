<b>Lattice Gas (Fluid Flow)</b>
</p>
<p>
A Lattice Gas Automaton, or LGA, is used to model fluid flow and diffusion. Particles 
travel along lattice lines and collide at nodes. The collisions follow 
rules that obey mass and momentum conservation. This particular LGA is 
frequently called an "FHP lattice gas" after Frisch, Hasslacher, and Pomeau who showed that 
it reproduces the Navier-Stokes equations that describe fluid flow.
<p>
How's it work? Each cell holds a collection of "water" particles in a vector (or array) of 
length 6. Each element of the vector is a 0 or a 1.  A 1 indicates 
the presence of a particle.  Each index of the vector indicates 
the neighbor towards which the particle is moving.  For example, 
if a cell has value [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], then it has three particles which are 
moving towards neighbors 1, 3, and 6.  The CA rule
consists of two steps: (1) translation to neighboring nodes, and (2) collision.
Translation just transfers the particles to their neighboring nodes; and subsequently, 
if more than one particle arrives at the same node, then they collide. Collisions are just 
a rearrangement of the particles so that the 1's change their indices in the vector. 
For example, if three particles arrived at a node as [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], then a 
collision might move them around to become [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1].&nbsp; Most importantly, the collisions are designed so that there is no change in mass and no 
change in momentum (inviolate conservation laws from physics). For more details on LGA 
and their rules, see my class notes on 
<a href="http://academic.regis.edu/dbahr/GeneralPages/CellularAutomata/CA_part16_files/frame.htm">LGA</a> 
or see one of the many other online references.
<p>
Note that the graphics do not show individual particle 
vectors, but instead show the vector sum of all particles that 
share a node.  For example, if two particles originate from the 
same node but are traveling in opposite directions, then their 
vector sum is zero, and nothing will be displayed. Vectors that 
cancel each other's contributions occur frequently.  However, 
sparsely populated grids will (in general) show the movement of 
distinct particles because there are fewer particles sharing 
nodes.

particle's vectors over time (set on the Properties panel).</b>
