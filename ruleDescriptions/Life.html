<b>The Game of Life</b>
<p>
A mesmerizing simulation invented by John Conway and popularized in Martin 
Gardner's Scientific American article, Mathematical Games (1970).  No 
players are involved in this "game".  Just set up an initial state and 
watch Life evolve. 
<p>
Cells are either occupied (live) or unoccupied (dead) and evolve according 
to the following rules. 
<ul>
	<li>A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies of loneliness. </li>
	<li>A live cell with 4 or more live neighbors dies of overcrowding. </li>
	<li>A live cell with exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors survives unchanged. </li>
	<li> A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors will come to life (birth). </li>
</ul>
On a square grid with 8 neighbors, "Life" is capable of universal 
computation. In other words, with the correct initial conditions, "Life" 
can calculate <i>anything</i> that your desktop computer can calculate, albeit 
more slowly. Wow! Check out the mostly user-friendly but complete

proof</a> in my class notes (requires some

background knowledge</a> of Turing Machines and Theory of Computation).
