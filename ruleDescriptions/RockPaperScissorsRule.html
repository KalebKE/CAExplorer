<b>Rock/Paper/Scissors</b>
<p>
Each cell is a rock, paper, or scissors.  The cell plays the well known game of Rock/Paper/Scissors with a 
random neighbor. If the cell wins or ties, 
then it keeps it's current value.  Otherwise the cell adopts the 
value of the neighbor.
<p>
Notice that the colors &quot;devour&quot; each other. That's because the color for paper 
wins against the color for rock, so the color for paper devours the rock. 
Similarly, the color for scissors will devour the color for paper, and the color 
for rock devours the color for scissors.<p>
