<b>Color Average</b>
<p>
Finds the average color of a cell and all of its neighbors. Each cell stores an integer 
array of size three, holding values from 0 to 255 for red, green and blue. 
<p>
This rule uses integer vectors and was written as an example for developers who wish 
to write their own cellular automaton rules for this program.
