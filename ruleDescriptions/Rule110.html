<b>Rule 110.</b>
<p>
A very simple one-dimensional 2-state rule that has been proven capable of 
universal computation by Matthew Cook. In other words, this ridiculously simple 
rule is capable of calculating anything that can be computed by the world's most 
powerful supercomputers. Intuitively, you can see information being transmitted 
by &quot;spaceships&quot; (or gliders) of various speeds which collide and produce other 
spaceships in a manner analogous to electrons moving through logic gates. The 
logic gates could be used to build a computer. However, the actual proof 
converts the CA to a &quot;cyclic tag system&quot; which is known to be equivalent to a 
Universal Turing Machine.<p>
What are some of the spaceships that &quot;transmit&quot; information? Look for patterns 
of triangles that meander through the background pattern. The ever-present 
background pattern is a repeating ...00010011011111... This pattern cycles back 
to the initial value every 7 time steps. Spaceships move through this 
background. For example,<ul>
	<li>Spaceship 1: 111 surrounded by the above background. Moves straight 
	downwards and repeats every 6 time steps.</li>
	<li>Spaceship 2: 1001111 surrounded by the above background. Moves left and 
	repeats every 30 time steps.</li>
	<li>Spaceship 3: 0001110111 surrounded by the above background. Moves right 
	and repeats every 3 time steps.</li>
	<li>Spaceship n: There are many others.</li>
	</ul>

The &quot;110&quot; 
comes from a cellular automata numbering scheme popularized by Stephen Wolfram.&nbsp; 
For details, see <a href="WolframRuleNumber.html">Wolfram 1-d Rules</a>.&nbsp; 
In essence, Rule 110 has the following mapping<ul>
		<li>111 -&gt; <font color="#FF0000">0</font></li>
		<li>110 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>101 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>100 -&gt; 0</li>
		<li>011 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>010 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>001 -&gt; 1</li>
		<li>000 -&gt; <font color="#00FFFF">0</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p>In other words, if the cell and its neighbors are 111, then at the 
		next time step the cell will become a 0.&nbsp; If the cell and its 
		neighbors are 110, then at the next time step the cell will become a 1.&nbsp; 
		Etc.&nbsp; All total, this corresponds to the binary number
		<font color="#FF0000">0</font>110111<font color="#00FFFF">0</font> which 
		is the number 110 in decimal.</p>

and running the &quot;Wolfram 1-d Rule&quot; in the Rule tab.
