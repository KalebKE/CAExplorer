<b> Fractal Threshold.</b>
</p>
<p>
Generates a steady-state fractal pattern from complex-valued cells.
<p>
This rule is takes the sum of the neighbors and subtracts the value of the cell.  If the modulus of 
this value is less than a threshold value of 10, then the cell is multiplied by 1.0 - i.  If the modulus 
of this value exceeds the modulus of the " full or maximum state" (5+5i), then it is set to 0+0i. Finally the 
resulting value "a" is transformed by a complex function f(a).  
The function f is "i tan(a)" by default, but may be reset 
in the "More Properties" window to other complex functions like f = i sin, (i+1) cos, i sinh, (i+1) tanh, etc. 
<p>
What is interesting is not the rule but the way in which the cell's are viewed. 
Each cell can be viewed as either the complex modulus (a shaded value that 
depends on the distance from origin) or as a fractal.  Fractals are derived from 
the equation z = z<sup>2</sup> + c where z (the value of the cell) is iterated repeatedly. 
If the value diverges, the cell is given a light (or empty) color.  If the value 
converges, the cell is given a dark (or full) color.  The rate at which it diverges 
determines shades in between -- the faster the divergence then the lighter the color, 
and the slower the divergence then the darker the color. 
<p>
The Mandelbrot set is derived when c is set to the initial value of the cell.  A 
Julia set is derived when c is a fixed value for all cells.  For Julia sets, the 
value of c may be set in the "More Properties" window. 
<p>
Clearly, a CA can have unique and unusual shapes and patterns when
viewed in a "different light" as a fractal.  In fact, that's the real lesson here.

is no one correct way to display a cellular automaton, and different displays may highlight
