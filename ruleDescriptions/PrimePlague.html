<b>Prime Plague</b>
<p>
Similar to Life, but creates a creeping plague.  Cells are born if they 
have exactly 3 "alive" neighbors.  They survive if they have a prime 
number of neighbors. Otherwise they die.
<p>
Only cells that have state 1 are counted as "alive".  When a cell 
dies, it slowly fades away by cycling through the higher valued 
states.  Once the highest state is reached, the cell is set to state 
0.  These higher valued states take space on the grid, but they do 
not count as alive neighbors. 
<p>
<b>Note</b> that this is the same rule as <a href="PistonPrime.html">Piston Prime</a> which only has 
4 states on an eight-neighbor square lattice. This rule has 13 states 
on a twelve-neighbor triangular lattice. The difference in behavior is 
dramatic.
