<b>Chain Link Fence</b>
<p>
When starting from a single seed, this rule builds a chain link fence that 
pulses while under construction.&nbsp; The number of states determines the 
distance between links in the fence.<p>
A more accurate description is given below, but essentially, each cell updates 
it's value to be one larger than it's smallest neighbor located to the North, 
South, East, and West.&nbsp; If the incremented cell is larger than the number 
of states, then it is wrapped-around to a value of 1 (not to 0, because that is 
used as an empty state that is not part of the fence).&nbsp; If all of the 
North, South, East, and West neighbors are 0, then the cell becomes a 0 as well.<p>
In detail, each cell updates it's value by the following rules:<ol>
	<li>If the cell value is 1, it stays that value. (This is a 
	link/intersection on the chain link fence.)</li>
	<li>If the minimum of all the neighbors is less than the minimum of the 
	neighbors to the North, South, East, and West, then the cell becomes a 0. 
	(In this situation, the cell is not located on the chain link fence and 
	should have the empty value.)</li>
	<li>If the minimum of all the neighbors is greater than or equal to the 
	minimum of the neighbors to the North, South, East, and West, then the cell 
	increments by one.&nbsp; If this increases the cell beyond the number of 
	states, then it is &quot;wrapped around&quot; and assigned a value of 1 (the smallest 
	value that can be part of the fence). (In this situation, the cell is on the 
	chain link fence and needs to become part of the fence).</li>
