<b>Forest Fire</b>
<p>
A simple model of forest fires. Trees grow in a forest and slowly age to maturity. Lightning strikes 
start fires which spread from mature trees to other neighboring mature trees.  Younger trees are "too green" 
and are not burned. After burning, the bare ground sprouts new trees and the process begins again. 
When running this simulation, be patient. It can take time to grow a 
mature forest that burns.<p>
While too simplistic for modeling real forest fires, this CA is an excellent example of "critical phenomena" and 
"percolation" from statistical physics.  Although lightning strikes are starting fires all the time, the fires 
cannot sweep across the forest until the mature trees reach a critical density.  At that critical value, the 
mature trees form a path from one side of the forest to the other.  In other words, you will not see big fires 
until the mature trees reach a critical density.
<p>
There are many variations on the basic "Forest Fire" CA.  This particular CA has 8 states.  
<ol>
	<li><i>Bare ground 
</i>(shown in brown) is the state from which trees sprout and is the state left after a forest fire has 
swept through (follows the ashes state). </li>
	<li><i>Seedlings</i> (lightest green) grow from bare ground. </li>
	<li><i>Saplings</i> (intermediate green) 
grow from seedlings. </li>
	<li><i>Young trees</i> (dark green) grow from saplings.</li>
	<li><i>Mature trees</i> (darkest green) 
grow from young trees. </li>
	<li><i>Burning</i> (yellow) is a mature tree that has caught fire.</li>
	<li><i>Smoldering</i> (red) follows the burning state (a dying fire).</li>
	<li><i>Ashes</i> (black) follows smoldering and are the remnants of a fire.</li>
	</ol>
<p>
Bare ground will sprout tree seedlings with probability 0.05. Each tree 
grows to the next stage with probability 0.01. Mature trees stay 
mature indefinitely. Lightning strikes and starts a fire on mature 
trees with probability 0.00001. Fires spread only from mature trees to neighboring mature 
trees. The fires quickly cycle through the states <i>burning</i> to <i>smoldering</i> to 
<i>ash</i> 
to <i>bare ground</i>. Once bare ground, the cycle repeats and new tree seedlings can 
sprout.</p>
<p>
This CA is a probabilistic generalization of <a href="CyclicCA.html">Cyclic CA</a>. In most cyclic CA the 
trigger number is a constant. In this CA, the trigger number is 0 for most 
states; but the trigger number is 1 for mature trees which need at least 1 
burning neighbor to cycle to the next (burning) state.&nbsp; States also cycle 
to the next state with some probability (rather than always cycling to the next 
state).</p>
