<p><b>Majority Wins With Median Reals</b></p>
<p>An amazingly reproduction of the <a href="MajorityWinsWithSelf.html">Majority 
Wins With Self</a> CA, but in this case using real values instead of integers.</p>
<p>Each cell is assigned the median value of itself and its neighbors.</p>
<p>Any integer-valued rule can be 
approximated by a real-valued rule, but Stephen Wolfram in <i>A New Kind of 
Science</i> has further hypothesized that real-valued (or complex, or etc.) 
rules do not confer any additional non-trivial behaviors beyond those already 
created by integer rules.&nbsp; In other words, Wolfram believes that classes I, 
II, III, and IV still apply to rules built from real numbers.&nbsp; At the very 
least, it is interesting to see integer-rule behaviors reproduced so nicely in 
real-valued rules.&nbsp; Or perhaps it's vice-versa.</p>
