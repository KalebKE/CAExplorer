<b>Majority Wins (with self)</b><p>
A model of decision making where a person makes their current opinion
match the majority of their neighbors' opinions (including their own opinion).  For example, a cell (or person) will decide to 
join a particular political party only if that party is in the majority (among their neighbors). 
If two neighbors are colored blue, six neighbors are colored red, and the cell 
itself is colored red, then the 
cell will decide to join the majority red party (7 out of 9 are red). In other words the cell will turn red. If there is a tie, the party is picked randomly.
<p>
Simulations with this rule will quickly come to a steady state with obvious 
clusters of each opinion.&nbsp;
This simulation is not quite as interesting as the strict <a href="MajorityWins.html">
Majority Wins</a> rule which excludes the opinion of the cell from the decision 
making.&nbsp; In that case, the cell is entirely influenced by its neighbors, and 
its own opinion matters not at all.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Simulations with 
the Majority Wins rule have more dynamic boundaries than this rule </font>(where the cell cannot quite 
make up its mind).<p>
This is one of a class of so-called voter models that have simple rules but 
surprisingly complex behavior.  These voter models have been used to simulate 
gawking behavior, jury decision making, rioting, herding, flocking, phase transitions (like 
water to ice), and a host of applications in particle physics where molecules check their 
neighboring molecules before moving.
