<b>Particle and Wire Network</b>
<p>
Allows particles to travel along a network, like electrons along a wire. Each 
cell is a wire, a particle with a weight, or a blank. An arrow indicates the 
direction that a particle is traveling or (in the case of wires) the direction 
that a particle is allowed to travel (so technically the wires behave as 
diodes). If two particles move into the same site, then their integer weights 
are combined (up to a maximum of 12).
<p>
A special "fanout" wire has no inherent direction and will disperse particles 
in all directions.  Each direction gets a particle with the same weight (whatever 
weight was held by the particle in the "fanout").  Note: this will increase the 
total weight of the particles in the simulation.
<p>
This rule was written primarily for developers that want an example with 
arbitrary graphics for each cell, and as a test of the computational capabilities 
of dendritic systems.  See the "Network computation" analysis (and research on 
glacier computations and
