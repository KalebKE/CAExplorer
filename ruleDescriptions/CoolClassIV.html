<b>Cool Class IV.</b>
<p>Stephen Wolfram divided all CA into behavioral classifications I, II, III, 
and IV. Class I may have transient behavior but eventually settles down to a 
single homogeneous state. Class II evolves into simple repetitive structures. 
Class III exhibits random and chaotic behaviors -- there may be some localized 
structure, but the overall pattern is complex and unpredictable. Class IV 
exhibit complex structures that are neither repetitive nor entirely random and 
may be capable of universal computation.&nbsp; In other words, class IV CA may 
be capable of anything that can be calculated by any other computer -- it's just 
a matter of interpreting the results correctly.&nbsp; Class IV CA are not rare, 
but they are the least common of the four classifications. For more information 
on behavioral classifications, see

<p>This CA is class IV, and although unproven, appears capable of universal 
computation. Information is clearly being transmitted by the complex patterns. 
This CA is given by totalistic rule 1329. Notice that the structures are 
entirely different from those generated by <a href="PrettyClassIV.html">Pretty 
Class IV</a>.</p>
