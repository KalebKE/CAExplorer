<b>Genetic Algorithm, &#960</b></p>
<p>
Uses a genetic algorithm to solve for &#960. Each cell holds a phenotype that contains a chromosome. 
The chromosome represents an estimate of
&#960 (as a binary number). At each time step, the
cell and its neighbors are treated as a population of phenotypes
that can breed and produce children. In particular, two phenotypes
are selected based on their fitness. They have higher fitness and
are more likely to be selected if they better approximate
&#960. Once
two chromosomes are picked (from among the cell and its neighbors)
then they produce an offspring by crossover and mutation. This
offspring is the cell's new value.
</p><p>
Better values of &#960 are shown in the occupied color, worse values in
the empty color (gradations in color are in between). High contrast colors work 
best. I suggest red values for empty sites (poor fitness) and blue values for 
filled sites (good fitness). Averages of 5 time steps show the evolution quite 
nicely.<p>
Try starting with a blank initial configuration (these are chromosomes
that are all 0's) and then draw in some chromosomes (they will have
random values).  The drawn in area will grow and expand because it has
better values.  Mutation will also make some of the blank spots (poor
chromosomes) switch to better values.  Occasionally these will grow.

<b> This simulation is memory intensive, so 50 by 50 grids in two
dimensions or 250 by 250 in one dimension are reasonable maximums.</b>
